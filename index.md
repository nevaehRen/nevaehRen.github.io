## We are interested in how cell-to-cell interactions balance the pancreatic islet’s Ca$^2^+$ activity, hormone secretion and contribute to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis.

We found as the minority cell types, δ and α cells form the core regulatory network for the robust rhythmicity of the entire islet.

By further developing high-throughput microfluidic chips, we are able to systematic explore the paracrine regulatory network of islet Ca2+ oscillation patterns. Additionally, novel probes have been developed to investigate the secretion patterns from α, β and δ cells.
