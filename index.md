## Our lab is interested in how cell-to-cell interactions within the pancreatic islet balance Ca$^{2+}$ activity and hormone secretion, as well as maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Through the integration of experimental, computational and theoretical methods, we aim to gain new insights for disease treatment.

## Highlights

We found as the minority cell types, δ and α cells form the core regulatory network for the robust rhythmicity of the entire islet. The design principle of the islet, characterized by a minority of regulators and a majority of followers, may extend to other biological systems with similar hierarchical organization, such as in the heart and brain.

By further developing high-throughput microfluidic chips, we are able to systematic explore the paracrine regulatory network of islet Ca$^{2+}$ oscillation patterns. Additionally, novel probes have been developed to investigate the secretion patterns from α, β and δ cells.
