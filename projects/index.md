We study how pancreatic islet cell-to-cell interactions shape oscillatory Ca$^{2+}$ activity, balancing hormone secretion and maintaining blood glucose homeostasis by employing microfluidic experiments and mathematical modeling.

## Background
The pancreatic islets are the most crucial blood glucose regulatory micro-organ in the body, primarily distributed in the head and tail of the pancreas (approximately 1,000 islets per mouse and about 1,000,000 islets per human). Each islet exhibits an independent hierarchical structure (Fig. 1A): approximately 5% of δ-cells (secreting somatostatin) and about 15% of α-cells (secreting glucagon) are mainly distributed on the surface, while around 80% of β-cells (secreting insulin) are concentrated in the center, with abundant paracrine regulation. Functionally, following high glucose stimulation, the islets display regular Ca2+ oscillations, categorized into fast, slow, and mixed oscillation patterns (Fig. 1B). The stability of islet Ca2+oscillation is highly correlated with the progression of diabetes; thus the regulatory mechanisms have been widely studied. 

Previous physiological research has primarily focused on the most abundant β-cells, while the less numerous α-cells and δ-cells have long been neglected. Moreover, most studies separate the secretion of glucagon by α-cells (raising blood sugar) from the secretion of insulin by β-cells (lowering blood sugar), such as activating β-cells under high glucose and α-cells under low glucose. However, within the body, these two types of cells are spatially intermingled and functionally interact each other through feedback mechanisms. This suggests that both hormones may be dynamically modulated by three types of islet cells simultaneously. Additionally, hypoglycemia is frequent in late-stage type 1 and type 2 diabetes, indicating significant abnormalities not only in insulin but also in glucagon function in patients. Therefore, the onset of the disease may stem from abnormalities in the regulation of both hormones.
