We study how pancreatic islet cell-to-cell interactions shape oscillatory Ca$^{2+}$ activity, balancing hormone secretion and maintaining blood glucose homeostasis by employing microfluidic experiments and mathematical modeling.

## Background
The pancreatic islets are the most crucial blood glucose regulatory micro-organ in the body, primarily distributed in the head and tail of the pancreas (approximately 1,000 islets per mouse and about 1,000,000 islets per human). Each islet exhibits an independent hierarchical structure (Fig. 1A): approximately 5% of δ-cells (secreting somatostatin) and about 15% of α-cells (secreting glucagon) are mainly distributed on the surface, while around 80% of β-cells (secreting insulin) are concentrated in the center, with abundant paracrine regulation. Functionally, following high glucose stimulation, the islets display regular Ca2+ oscillations, categorized into fast, slow, and mixed oscillation patterns (Fig. 1B). The stability of islet Ca2+ oscillation is highly correlated with the progression of diabetes; thus the regulatory mechanisms have been widely studied.
