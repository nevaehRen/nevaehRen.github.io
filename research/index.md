We have developed novel technologies such as microfluidic islet chips and imaging chemical probes/bio-sensors to investigate the regulation of islet Ca$^{2+}$  activity patterns and hormone secretion by intra-islet paracrine interactions. These studies also involved the development of quantitative data analysis methods and mathematical modeling.
