December 25, 2024 – We invited Chief Physician Shusen Wang from Tianjin First Central Hospital. Dr. Wang presented recent advances in stem cell‑derived islet transplantation, a promising therapy for type 1 diabetes that addresses the shortage of donor islets. The talk highlighted research published in Cell and Nature Medicine, demonstrating how lab‑grown islets can restore insulin function in humans and primates.
