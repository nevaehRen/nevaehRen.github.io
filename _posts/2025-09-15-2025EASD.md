Vienna, Austria – September 15–19, 2025. The Ren Laboratory participated in the 61st Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), held at the Vienna Congress & Convention Center. The congress brought together almost 14,000 international researchers, clinicians, and healthcare professionals to exchange the latest advances in diabetes research and care.

Dr. Ren delivered a talk on “Pancreatic islet oscillation rhythmicity arises from delta and alpha cell interactions”. PhD student Yawen Deng gave a short oral presentation on “Pancreatic islet calcium oscillation rhythm shifts synchronously to maintain blood glucose stability”. The work showcased our latest advances using in vivo and in vitro long-term multi-islet calcium imaging to reveal how oscillatory dynamics differ between healthy and diabetic states.
