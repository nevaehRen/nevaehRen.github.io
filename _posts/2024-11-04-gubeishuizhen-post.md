Beijing, Nov. 4, 2024 – Lab members from Ren Lab and the Wu Zhaofa Lab at the Institute of Genetics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, embarked on a joint autumn trip to Gubei Water Town. The group explored the Simatai Great Wall, experienced traditional folk activities such as tie‑dyeing, and enjoyed the picturesque autumn scenery. The outing provided a relaxed setting for scientists from both labs to interact, share ideas, and build new friendships. The event strengthened interdisciplinary connections and fostered a spirit of collaboration beyond the laboratory.
