Dec. 18, 2025, PhD candidates Wang Xuejiao and Yang Sen successfully defended their thesis proposals at the Ren Huixia Laboratory.
Wang Xuejiao’s research topic is titled 'The function of pancreatic delta cells in health and diabetes: early links to reduced endogenous somatostatin release'.
Yang Sen’s thesis proposal focuses on the divergent roles of α- and δ-cells in tuning pancreatic islet glucose sensitivity during glycemic elevation and reduction.
These defense sessions marked a key milestone in their doctoral research journeys, with their proposed studies promising to provide valuable insights into pancreatic cell biology and diabetes-related mechanisms. Congratulations!
