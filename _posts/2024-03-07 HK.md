On Mar. 7th, Brain & Endocrine: Back to the Basics conference was held in Hong Kong. Dr. Huixia Ren gave an oral presentation “δ-α cell-to-cell interactions modulate pancreatic islet Ca²⁺ oscillation modes”. In this conference, leading experts shared their latest scientific insights into the intricate mechanisms behind the release of brain signals and hormones in response to external stimuli, as well as how these signals shape our behavior and metabolism. Explore cutting-edge research on the interplay between neuronal circuits and hormone pathways, and their impact on diverse aspects of physiology and disease.
