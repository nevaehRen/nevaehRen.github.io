Abnormal regulation of innate behaviors such as defense, eating and sleep leads to impaired homeostasis. Leading experts shared the latest scientific insights and technology development in sleep homeostasis, brain control of body homeostasis and brain-body interactions. In an open and exploratory academic environment, the speaker and the participants engaged in constructive and in-depth discussion, jointly expanding the cognitive boundaries of this cutting-edge field. Lab members Dr. Huixia Ren, Dr. Zhenchao Fu and student Yawen Deng attended the conference. Yawen introduced her study in poster.
