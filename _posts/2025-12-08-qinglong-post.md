Beijing, Nov. 7-8, 2025-To strengthen inter-lab collaboration and take a break from research, members of Ren Lab and Wu Zhaofa Lab at the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, went on a two-day autumn trip to Qinglong Gorge in Huairou District, Beijing. The group walked along canyon trails, admired the autumn scenery with glistening water and colorful foliage, explored the nearby Great Wall, and tried the thrilling bungee jumping. On the first night, they enjoyed a hot pot feast and a cozy karaoke session together. This trip helped researchers unwind, deepen mutual understanding, and lay a solid foundation for future interdisciplinary cooperation.
