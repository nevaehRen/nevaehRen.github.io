From August 26–28, 2025, we co-organized the “Digital Life Forum: Trans-Scale Imaging and Integrative Islet Biology” in Huairou Science City, Beijing. The forum brought together global experts to discuss innovations in imaging and islet biology, with a focus on diabetes research.

All lab members attended the forum. Postdoc Dr. Zhenchao Fu, phd student Xuejiao Wang and Yawen Deng presented posters on islet calcium dynamics, somatostatin secretion, and in vivo imaging.

Dr. Ren delivered an oral presentation titled “Hyperglycemia to Euglycemia Shift Pancreatic Islets Rhythmicity in vivo, Impairment in Diabetes”, highlighting glycemia-driven changes in islet oscillation patterns and their disruption in diabetes.

The forum provided a valuable platform for exchanging ideas across imaging, systems biology, and clinical research.
