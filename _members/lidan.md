Hello! I’m Dan Li. My research focuses on exploring and discovering molecules that can locally promote GLP-1 secretion from pancreatic α cells through high - throughput screening. By leveraging this powerful technique, we aim to identify key molecules and targets, unravel their interaction mechanisms within α cells, and lay the foundation for developing targeted therapies for diabetes.
