Hello, My name is YoungSing. I specialize in exploring the intricate pathways of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. My work focuses on understanding how cellular heterogeneity impacts hormone secretion and the role of exogenous hormones in isletsâ€™ action. Our team combines expertise in bioengineering, data science, and clinical research to revolutionize diabetes therapy. I take a great interest in unraveling the pathophysiological action of islets in healthy human and diabetes. Do you want to be part of our team, Welcome to our laboratory.
