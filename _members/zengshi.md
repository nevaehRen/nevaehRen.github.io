 I am a 2024 first-year graduate student in Rehabilitation Therapy at Fujian Medical University, where I focus on exercise-related research. I am currently conducting research in Dr. Hui Xia’s laboratory at the Chinese Instiutes for Medical Research, delving into the mechanisms of Ca²⁺ oscillations and secretion in pancreatic islets. By integrating exercise physiology with islet biology, I aim to elucidate how physical activity influences islet Ca²⁺ dynamics and hormone release. I am deeply passionate about this work and confident that it will yield significant results.
