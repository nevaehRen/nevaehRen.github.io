My work centers on animal genome editing, with a specific emphasis on developing gene-editing systems for animals. I aim to enhance the editing efficiency and accuracy in primary cells, using gene editing tools like CRISPR/Cas9 to enable precise genetic modifications in animals or biomedically relevant species.
