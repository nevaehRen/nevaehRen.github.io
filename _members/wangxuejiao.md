Hello everyone! I'm Wang Xuejiao from Yantai, Shandong Province. I'm currently pursuing my doctoral studies, focusing on the functions of Î´ cells in pancreatic islets. My research aims to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing these cells' functions and explore potential therapeutic strategies for diabetes. I'm excited about our research and welcome anyone passionate about this topic to join our group. Thank you!
