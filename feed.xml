<p>Dr. Ren delivered a talk on “Pancreatic islet oscillation rhythmicity arises from delta and alpha cell interactions”. PhD student Yawen Deng gave a short oral presentation on “Pancreatic islet calcium oscillation rhythm shifts synchronously to maintain blood glucose stability”. The work showcased our latest advances using in vivo and in vitro long-term multi-islet calcium imaging to reveal how oscillatory dynamics differ between healthy and diabetic states.</p>]]></content><author><name>dengyawen</name></author><category term="conference" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vienna, Austria – September 15–19, 2025.
