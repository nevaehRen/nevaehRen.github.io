The forum brought together global experts to discuss innovations in imaging and islet biology, with a focus on diabetes research.</p>

<p>All lab members attended the forum. Postdoc Dr. Zhenchao Fu, phd student Xuejiao Wang and Yawen Deng presented posters on islet calcium dynamics, somatostatin secretion, and in vivo imaging.</p>

<p>Dr. Ren delivered an oral presentation titled “Hyperglycemia to Euglycemia Shift Pancreatic Islets Rhythmicity in vivo, Impairment in Diabetes”, highlighting glycemia-driven changes in islet oscillation patterns and their disruption in diabetes.</p>

<p>The forum provided a valuable platform for exchanging ideas across imaging, systems biology, and clinical research.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">CIMR 2025 Annual Retreat</title><link href="https://nevaehren.github.io/2025/08/27/CIMR.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CIMR 2025 Annual Retreat" /><published>2025-08-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T09:50:43+00:00</updated><id>https://nevaehren.github.io/2025/08/27/CIMR</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://nevaehren.github.io/2025/08/27/CIMR.html"><![CDATA[<p>CIMR held the 2025 Annual Retreat from August 27 to August 29, 2025, at Sunshine International Conference Center, Beijing.
