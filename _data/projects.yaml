  description: By developing a microfluidic islet experimental system and generating transgenic mice with dual-color Ca2+ markers for α and β cells, it was observed islet α and β cells exhibited global phase locking of Ca2+ activity.

  description: Using a novel extracellular Zn2+ probe to observe insulin vesicle secretion, it was found that the secretion capacity of islet β cells exhibits heterogeneity. Pharmacological blockade of δ cells disrupted the exponential distribution, leading to a more uniform secretion capacity among cells.

  description: Despite constituting only 5% of islet cells, delta cells' functions have been underestimated in previous studies. Continuous adjustment of δ-α coupling strength caused the fast oscillating islets to transition to mixed and slow oscillations.

  description: Pancreatic islets from healthy mice exhibit regular Ca2+ oscillations, while those of diabetic mice show a cessation of Ca2+ oscillation activity. We wish to explore the molecular mechanisms that impairs the oscillation in diabetic islets.
