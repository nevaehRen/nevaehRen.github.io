  description: By developing a microfluidic islet experimental system and generating transgenic mice with dual-color Ca2+ markers for α and β cells, it was observed islet α and β cells exhibited global phase locking of Ca2+ activity. Further investigation using mathematical modeling explored the quantitative relationship between the coupling strength of α and β cells and the oscillation patterns, revealing that α cells are crucial for generating fast oscillations in the islets. Validation studies showed that islets enriched with α cells exhibited fast oscillations, while islets lacking α cells displayed slow Ca2+ oscillations. This study demonstrated that the heterogeneity of islet Ca2+ oscillation patterns is shaped by intra-islet paracrine heterogeneity.

  description: This study introduced a novel extracellular Zn2+ probe to observe insulin vesicle secretion events with high spatiotemporal resolution. It was found that the secretion capacity of islet β cells exhibits heterogeneity - both the cellular secretion capacity and the quantitative distribution of cells follow an exponential distribution and are independent of glucose stimulation. Pharmacological blockade of δ cells disrupted the exponential distribution, leading to a more uniform secretion capacity among cells. In the progression of diabetes, the coupling between β-cell Ca2+ signals and vesicle secretion is impaired, further increasing the heterogeneity of secretion capacity. This study revealed that intra-islet paracrine heterogeneity shapes the secretion heterogeneity of β cells.
