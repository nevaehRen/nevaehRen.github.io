  description: By developing a microfluidic islet experimental system and generating transgenic mice with dual-color Ca2+ markers for α and β cells, it was observed islet α and β cells exhibited global phase locking of Ca2+ activity. Further investigation using mathematical modeling explored the quantitative relationship between the coupling strength of α and β cells and the oscillation patterns, revealing that α cells are crucial for generating fast oscillations in the islets. Validation studies showed that islets enriched with α cells exhibited fast oscillations, while islets lacking α cells displayed slow Ca2+ oscillations. This study demonstrated that the heterogeneity of islet Ca2+ oscillation patterns is shaped by intra-islet paracrine heterogeneity.

  description: This study introduced a novel extracellular Zn2+ probe to observe insulin vesicle secretion events with high spatiotemporal resolution. It was found that the secretion capacity of islet β cells exhibits heterogeneity - both the cellular secretion capacity and the quantitative distribution of cells follow an exponential distribution and are independent of glucose stimulation. Pharmacological blockade of δ cells disrupted the exponential distribution, leading to a more uniform secretion capacity among cells. In the progression of diabetes, the coupling between β-cell Ca2+ signals and vesicle secretion is impaired, further increasing the heterogeneity of secretion capacity. This study revealed that intra-islet paracrine heterogeneity shapes the secretion heterogeneity of β cells.

- title: Mechanisms of Glucose Sensitivity Regulation in Diabetic Mouse Pancreatic Islets
  subtitle: Disappearance and Recovery of Ca2+ Oscillation

  description: Under 10 mM glucose stimulation, pancreatic islets from healthy mice exhibit regular Ca2+ oscillations, while those of diabetic mice show a cessation of Ca2+ oscillation activity. However, when glucose concentration decreases to 7 mM, pancreatic islets of diabetic mice display regular Ca2+ oscillations. These results indicate an increased glucose sensitivity in diabetic mouse pancreatic islets, with no impairment in Ca2+ oscillation capability. In the future, we wish to explore the molecular mechanisms of paracrine factors that control the glucose sensitivity in pancreatic islets.

- title: In vivo Islet Ca2+ Imaging
  subtitle: in vitro + in vivo

  description: We developed in vivo pancreatic islet Ca2+ functional imaging using two-photon microscopy. Together with in situ pancreas islet imaging, we also developed kidney capsule transplantation imaging system. Compared to the native pancreatic islet system, the internal paracrine regulatory network of islets remained intact in the kidney capsule transplant system, while significant changes occurred in vascular and neural regulation outside the islets. Therefore, similarities observed in both systems support the role of intra-islet paracrine regulation. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the Ca2+ oscillation period of islets is primarily regulated by intra-islet alpha and delta cell paracrine interactions, we wish to investigate whether in the islet Ca2+ oscillation period is primarily determined by its internal paracrine regulatory network in vivo  repo: greenelab/lab-website-template
